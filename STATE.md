## Active task

Paused 2026-10-09 01:15 at a clean point (Dylan). v1 runs end to end on the Jetson (D73, D75): Hey Edgy (arm A), visitor-scoped memory and history, consent offer after a name (D69), faces (M3 33/33, zero false identities), named objects with DINOv2 (D64), focus object and booth screen with the memory panel (D67), evidence fixes (D75), decode pause (first audio about 1.4 s p50 with audio). Code answers stay; one voice ties them (research/one-voice.patch).

Next session, in order:

1. Rule 6 check: a fresh one-time unseen probe set for the V1-E evidence changes (objects removed, gone, still there, ownership), run once on the Jetson; record the m2 gain (39 -> 44/74, dev-only) as confirmed or not.
2. One voice decision: rerun research/one-voice.patch vs the code answers with the box (bench/brain_bakeoff.py --host dylan@192.168.1.74) for prompt and brain variants, then once on the Jetson; retire the code answers when not worse (D61, D74).
3. Wire the remaining v1 pieces only if cheap: the greeting (D63), intents shard (D62), Formula decay and Rrf (D62). Otherwise straight to:
4. Live test day with Dylan (human checklist below; speaker first if it has arrived): faces at distance, real objects, Hey Edgy in noise, focus in a crowd, echo; record everything as fixtures; then promote the edge cases that actually happen (research/edge-cases.md).
5. After the live day (D62): decide optimizations and training from the biggest measured gaps (brain size: the 4B needs about 400 to 900 MB freed, D68; detector hand class; LoRA on the 3080 box).

Running jobs: none. The 3080 box (dylan@192.168.1.74) is idle; ~/qdrant-robot-box holds llama.cpp 9c2e0e4 and the GGUFs.

## Where to read first

- research/lessons.md: every avenue explored and every pitfall, with decision links (CLAUDE.md rule: keep it current). Read it after this file.
- DECISIONS.md D35 to D75 (today's work); research/v1-plan.md (the adopted v1 plan); research/booth-ux.md (focus, screen, turn-taking); research/assistant-design.md; research/grounding.md (brain bake-off); research/edge-cases.md (logged, not fixed); research/faces.md, research/m2-design.md, research/m3-design.md, research/wakeword.md, research/sight.md, research/endpointing.md; research/one-voice.patch (retrieval-into-brain variant, not applied).
- gates/review.md rules 6 (overfitting), 7 (proportion), 8 (v1: log edge cases).

## Robot access

- 3080 box (Dylan, 2026-10-08): `ssh dylan@192.168.1.74` (key auth; WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04; RTX 3080 10 GB; CUDA 12.6 at /usr/local/cuda; no passwordless sudo). For brain and prompt bake-offs, parallel text replays, judging, and later training; acceptance numbers stay on the Jetson. Setup task X1 running (llama.cpp 9c2e0e4, parity with the Jetson).

- `ssh robot` works with a key (Host entry in `~/.ssh/config`: `qdrant-robot.local`, user `qdrant`). Passwordless sudo works. Internet works.
- Serial fallback only when Dylan plugs in the debug USB-C cable (unplugged now): `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`, 115200 baud, user `qdrant`, password in `.env`.
- Network: Wi-Fi on the home LAN (192.168.1.238 by DHCP). The course robot's `l6-hotspot` does not autoconnect. Never re-enable the hotspot over SSH.
- Workflow: `tools/jetson.py deploy | run NAME [--wait] -- ARGS | collect | rollback`. Releases in `/home/qdrant/qdrant-robot/releases/<hash>`, `current` and `previous` symlinks; models, memory, results, llama.cpp in `shared/`. Deployed: `5fd5253828fa` (the held-out run; the timeout revert after it touches only eval/replay.py). Models: `python -m tools.models` verifies `models.json`.
- Acceptance run from the Mac: `python3 eval/run.py [--model M] [--oracle | --audio audio-real] [cases]` deploys, replays, collects, judges, and checks speech. Real-voice fixtures: `tools/record.py <cases> [--check]`.

## Finding your way in the evidence

- One line per run: `grep -h '"summary"' bench/results/*.jsonl` (model, release, n, correct, p50s, `tegrastats` file, the system prompt once). Per-turn rows hold the heard text, answer, evidence ids, stage times, and the prompt without the system message.
- `<result>.judged.jsonl`: one verdict per turn (`pass`, `why`). `*.tegrastats`: memory, clocks, temperatures, named `<job>-<date>-<time>.tegrastats`; a result's summary row names its file. Files without a date are from before 2026-10-08 04:00.
- `tools/gate.py checks` runs ruff, vulture, pytest, the module self-checks (`python -m robot.<module>`), and the tool selftests. The pre-commit hook runs it.

## Robot facts (2026-10-08)

- L4T R39.2.0, Ubuntu 24.04.4, Python 3.12.3, headless. CUDA 13.2.2, cuDNN 9.20, TensorRT 10.16.2 from apt. llama.cpp 9c2e0e4 built with `GGML_CUDA_NO_VMM=ON` in `shared/src/llama.cpp`. Details: `research/stack.md`.
- Power: MAXN_SUPER (D31): GPU 1,020 MHz, EMC 3,199 MHz, CPU 1,728 MHz. Qwen3-VL-2B decode 36.0 tok/s, prefill 1,492 tok/s. The 15W thermal test peaked at 59.9 °C; the MAXN thermal test is pending.
- RAM 7,485 MB; about 6,000 MB available idle (D20). 8 GB swap file. NVMe about 130 GB free.
- Camera: mounted upside down, frames rotated 180° in `robot/camera.py`; 16 fps at 1280x720 MJPG. The USB hub disabled its port once under MAXN (D32): watch for recurrence; a reopen watchdog is unowned. Microphone: the camera's (ALSA `plughw:CARD=Light`). No speaker: answers are saved as WAVs.
- Services: `l6-robot.service` stopped and disabled (D18); `memory-robot-clock.service` kept.

## Git

Standing approval to commit and push (CLAUDE.md). Remote `origin` = github.com/Dylancouzon/qdrant-robot (private). Branches: `main` (everything reviewed), `spike/detector` (rebased on main, unmerged), `box/3080` (mailbox, at main).

## Checkpoints

- C6: replay split scoring, length-scaled hangover, overfitting rule, M2 fixtures (D37, D38).
- C0, C1: harness and architecture rethink. C2: M1.1 (`reviews/20261008-010719-8012-review.md`). C3: M1.2 (`reviews/20261008-020746-59698-review.md`). C4: M1.3 quality work (`reviews/20261008-084259-59432-review.md`). C5: repo hygiene, Edge benchmark, 4B re-run, recorder check (D34 to D36).

## Unmet targets

All CLAUDE.md targets unmeasured at acceptance scale except Edge query (met, D36). Interim (no speaker, MAXN): first synthesized audio 1.45 s p50 dev, 1.58 s held-out, against 1.2 s; decode 36.0 tok/s meets 30. Held-out answers 18/26 real voices (69% against 90%).

## Milestones and acceptance

Each milestone ends with a robot a visitor can use. Interim numbers are proposed targets (D16); the final targets are in CLAUDE.md.

| ID | Milestone | Visitor experience and acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | It talks | Answers questions about the current camera view and about Qdrant aloud, on the Jetson alone. 90% correct or more; audio latency 2 s median, 4 s p95 or better; 30 minutes without restart |
| M2 | It remembers | Recalls removed objects, left and right observations, and evicted conversation, including after a restart. Dylan (2026-10-08): name an object by voice ("this is my phone": several crops as one multivector point, MaxSim) and recall it by name, labels on the video view, "forget my phone" deletes it, "ignore the chair" stops remembering it. 90% per capability; Edge search 10 ms p99; M1 speech targets held |
| M3 | It knows you | Enrolls a face with consent, recognizes returning visitors (face multivector, MaxSim), handles a new visitor replacing the last, forgets on request. 90% known-person recognition; zero false identities on held-out strangers |
| M4 | Booth-ready | Every capability offline with Jetson-connected audio for eight hours. Final CLAUDE.md targets: 1.2 s p50 and 2 s p95 audible latency, 15 fps tracking while talking, 500 MB headroom with no swap, held-out eval at target |
| M5 | Add-on | Offline Wikipedia knowledge shard, only if every M4 target still holds |

## M1 tasks

- [x] **M1.1 Stack qualification.** Done 2026-10-08.
- [x] **M1.2 Vertical slice.** Done 2026-10-08 (C3).
- [x] **M1.3 Decision run.** End to end with gaps (D40): real-voice dev 42/47, held-out 18/26, endpointing done (D38); 1,886 MB headroom (D28).
- [x] **M1.4 It talks.** End to end with gaps (D40): knowledge shard calibrated on dev (M1.4a, verbatim facts, unseen paraphrases 0.85 to 0.98), current-camera questions scored; sight naming in clutter carried (D39).
- [x] **M1.5 Milestone gate.** MILESTONE MET under D40 (`reviews/20261008-111211-5165-milestone.md`). Carried: 30 minutes without restart not yet run; research drift (stack.md Super mode, m2-design.md fusion and ignore) to clean in M2.

## Human checklist (live test day, when Dylan is at the robot)

Fixtures so far are photos and recorded audio fed as files; the live camera was checked only for capture and fps. Dylan (2026-10-08): get as far as possible first, then a live testing phase.

1. Audio: the camera microphone is the input. Speaker ordered (Waveshare USB card, 8 ohm 5 W): plug into the Jetson, run with `--speaker`, measure audible latency, check echo into the camera microphone, compare the card's microphone if any. Test the camera microphone at about 1 m with background noise before buying another microphone.
2. Faces (M3.2): Dylan, then colleagues if present, at 0.5, 1, and 2 m, frontal and turned: record clips to recalibrate the face threshold on robot-camera frames (D45: dev margin 0.011).
3. Objects (M2): show, name, remove, and move real objects (phone, mug, bag) left and right; record the session as fixtures.
4. Spoken session end to end with the speaker: every capability, interruptions, a long pause mid-question.
5. Calibrate `SCENE_CHANGE` on a lit, static scene; watch for the camera USB port fault (D32).

Without a human: 30-minute live soak done (D47: stable; closes the M1 30-minute check without speech); hours-long soak next. Clips: `shared/clips/live-items-1.avi` (90 s, Dylan handling items, unscripted). Live sessions: snapshot with thirds first, timed cues to the end, record only after Dylan says ready.

## Facts from Dylan

- The Mac's microphone and speaker may be used during development; the camera microphone is on the Jetson.
- Gemma license accepted on Hugging Face; the token is on the Mac (`~/.cache/huggingface/token`).
- Persona and voice: free choice. Room lights may be off at night.
- 2026-10-07 night: "Don't stop at good"; targets are a floor; keep improving models and capabilities.
- 2026-10-08: review session; hand off at a sensible point, no new milestone work.
